# **Team Planning Workshop Guide**  
*(Refined for Clarity & Usability)*  

---

### **Introduction**  
Purposefully designed for **Product**, **Mission**, and **Operations** teams—not a one-size-fits-all approach. Focuses on:  
- Reducing uncertainty  
- Enhancing progress transparency  
- Increasing adaptability to market changes  

---

### **Signals Indicating Need for Planning**  
*Tailored to team types:*  

| **Product Teams**                | **Mission Teams**                | **Operations Teams**             |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| - Short-cycle planning cadence   | - Short-cycle planning cadence   | - Short-cycle triage cadence     |
| - Defined sync/async activities  | - Defined sync/async activities  | - Defined sync/async activities  |
| - Refined, prioritized backlog  | - Committed objectives           | - All work sources visible       |
| - Backlog decomposed into value  | - Work prioritized by delay cost | - Work selection by Impact/SLA   |
| - Timeboxed capacity plan        | - Decomposed/sequenced backlog   | - Identified risks               |
| - Identified risks               | - Identified risks               |                                  |

### **Value Proposition**  
- **Reduces meeting bloat** via async collaboration + targeted sync conversations.  
- Creates a **"living document"** for plan adaptation & organizational transparency.  
- Ensures focus on **highest-value work** while maintaining short feedback loops.  

---

### **Live Facilitation Guidelines**  
- **Session Duration**: Max 120 mins for all sections:  
  `People Impacts` → `Dependencies` → `Action Targets` → `Team Roadmap` → `Persistent Activities`.  
- **Timeboxes**: Assign per section. If timing slips, create follow-up actions.  
- **Efficiency**: Skip low-value activities. Ownership: *Facilitator owns process; team owns content*.  
- **Psychological Safety**: Acknowledge fears; establish boundaries upfront.  

---

### **Async Facilitation Best Practices**  
- **Fluency**: Scale async based on team norms (avoid overloading meeting-averse teams).  
- **Unboxed Time**: Set constraints to prevent over-investment in low-value tasks.  
- **Data Capture**: Use surveys/existing data to pre-load activities.  
- **Constraints**: Document leader-decided constraints explicitly.

### **Workshop Sections & Instructions**  

#### **1. Persistent Activities**  
- **Goal**: Catalog recurring tasks competing for capacity.  
- **Activity**:  
  - Brainstorm admin/persistent tasks.  
  - For each task:  
    - Note capacity required (time/people).  
    - Challenge negotiability (e.g., "mandatory" → "negotiable").  
  - **Team-Specific Tips**:  
    - *Mission*: Align with mission timebox.  
    - *Product*: Focus on weekly activities in iterations.  
    - *Ops*: Audit day-to-day tasks.  

#### **2. Team Roadmap**  
- **Pre-Planning**:  
  - Refine/prioritize backlog *before* planning (not during).  
  - Minimize gap between refinement and planning.  

- **Activity by Team Type**:  
  | **Mission Teams**              | **Product Teams**                | **Operations Teams**             |  
  |------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
  | Sequence work by **Cost of Delay**. | Estimate capacity using metrics:<br>- Lead time<br>- Throughput<br>- Story points | Focus on **planned/unplanned work ratio** & seasonal trends. |  
  | Metrics: Capacity, System Time, Throughput, WIP. | Include experiments (time-boxed). | Metrics: Lead time, Work Item Type, Task Throughput. |  
  | Overflow work → "Month" column (loosely sequence top 3). | Overflow work → "Month" column. | Plan only plannable work (preserve capacity). |  

#### **3. People Impacts**  
- **Goal**: Identify groups impacted by/impacting the work.  
- **Activity**:  
  - Place stakeholders in categories:  
    - **Detractor** (high disruption risk)  
    - **Significant** (key communication needed)  
    - **Advocate** (supports the team)  
    - **Minimal** (transparency only)  
    - **Unknown** (requires consultation).  
  - Agree on engagement actions → Log in "Actions" section.  

#### **4. Our Dependencies**  
- **Goal**: Map blockers to delivery.  
- **Activity**:  
  - Categorize dependencies:  
    - **Another Team** (dependent on them)  
    - **Our Team** (others dependent on us).  
  - Tag each:  
    - `Escalate` (needs leadership)  
    - `Support` (needs expertise)  
    - `Correction` (team can fix)  
    - `Prioritize` (impacts plan).  
  - Focus on top 3 critical dependencies.  

#### **5. Action Target**  
- **Goal**: Track & prioritize actions.  
- **Activity**:  
  - Place actions on timeline:  
    - **Do Now** (≤24hr)  
    - **Do Soon** (≤48hr)  
    - **Do Later** (≤72hr).  
  - Assign owners (responsible for resolution).

### **Wrapping Up**  
- **Affirm Confidence**: Poll team confidence (scale 1–10; >7 = acceptable).  
- **Outputs**:  
  - Defined roadmap & persistent work.  
  - Mapped impacts/dependencies.  
  - Action plan with owners.  
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Migrate plans to team workflow tools.  
  - Use outputs for **new member onboarding**.  
  - Revisit plans quarterly/after major changes.

### **Pre-Workshop Prep**  
- **Context Matters**: Tailor to Product/Mission/Ops teams.  
- **General Tips**:  
  - Use async for status reporting (recorded demos > meetings).  
  - **Show outcomes** (don’t just explain).  
  - Make sessions **engaging**, not intimidating.  
  - Pair updates with data (e.g., "How many impacted?").
