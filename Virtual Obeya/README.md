# **Virtual Obeya Design Studio**  
*Enabling Timely Decisions in Remote/Hybrid Environments*

---

### **Introduction**  
A Virtual Obeya serves as a central aggregator and radiator of organizational information, enabling timely decisions and interventions in remote/hybrid work contexts.

---

### **Signals Indicating Need for an Obeya**  
*Absence or decentralization of:*  
- **Strategy Decomposition**  
  Accessible breakdown of organizational strategy for all members.  
- **Work Portfolio Visibility**  
  Unified view of work across teams, programs, or organizational areas.  
- **Performance & Flow Metrics**  
  Progress, performance, and flow efficiency tracking.  
- **Team Health Data**  
  Personal/team health, social connections, working hours.  

---

### **Value Proposition**  
Enables leaders and teams to:  
- Aggregate critical information (business performance, cultural heuristics).  
- Make expedient, fact-based decisions and interventions.  

---

### **Facilitation Framework**  
#### **Live Facilitation (120 mins max)**  
- **Timeboxes:**  
  Allocate time per MADO (Strategy/Data/Work/Culture). Stick to timelines; capture unfinished work as actions.  
- **Ownership:**  
  Facilitator owns *process*; participants own *content/outcomes*.  
- **Psychological Safety:**  
  Acknowledge potential intimidation; invite boundary-setting.  
- **Efficiency Tip:**  
  Skip low-value activities to focus on high-impact work.  

#### **Async Facilitation**  
- **Fluency Scaling:**  
  Match async intensity to team collaboration norms.  
- **Constraints:**  
  Document leader-decided constraints upfront.  
- **Data Capture:**  
  Pre-load activities via surveys/existing data.  
- **Time Management:**  
  Prevent over-investment in low-value tasks.

### **MADO Framework**  
*Four windows for organizational visibility*  

#### **Strategy MADO**  
**Purpose:** Window into strategic direction, progress, impediments, and leader interventions.  
- **Activity:** Identify required information types (e.g., roadmaps, OKRs).  
- **Process:**  
  1. Brainstorm information needs.  
  2. Group similar items → Vote (2 votes/person) → Prioritize top 5.  
  3. Discuss merits → Final vote (1 vote/person).  

#### **Data MADO**  
**Purpose:** Window into business/customer/delivery/risk performance.  
- **Activity:** Define dynamic metrics (e.g., OKRs, flow efficiency).  
- **Process:** *Same as Strategy MADO.*  

#### **Work MADO**  
**Purpose:** Window into work portfolio, dependencies, and interventions.  
- **Activity:** Capture needs (e.g., dependency maps, planning events).  
- **Process:** *Same as Strategy MADO.*  

#### **Culture MADO**  
**Purpose:** Window into cultural health for proactive interventions.  
- **Activity:** Identify cultural metrics (e.g., team health checks, values alignment).  
- **Process:** *Same as Strategy MADO.*

### **Cross-MADO Activities**  
*(Apply to all MADOs)*  

#### **Frequency**  
**Script:** *"How often must information refresh to stay useful? Ignore tool constraints—focus on need."*  
**Process:**  
- Assign refresh rates (real-time/daily/weekly).  
- Treat unmet needs as "information gaps."  

#### **Ownership**  
**Script:** *"Who owns existing data? Who should own new data streams?"*  
**Process:**  
- Assign owners per information type.  
- Capture actions for unowned/new items.  

#### **Information Gaps**  
**Script:** *"What’s missing from our current data?"*  
**Process:**  
- Audit previous sections for gaps.  
- Define actions to close gaps.  

#### **Tooling Gaps**  
**Script:** *"Do tools exist to support our needs?"*  
**Process:**  
- Identify missing tool capabilities.  
- Assign actions to procure/build tools.  

#### **Risk Assessment**  
**Script:** *"What confidentiality, integrity, or availability risks exist?"*  
**Process:**  
- Brainstorm risks → Group similar items → Assign mitigations.  
- **Key:** Adjust risk appetite, don’t block progress.

### **Wrapping Up**  
**Critical Actions:**  
1. **Commit to Implementation:**  
   - Set deadlines for actions.  
2. **Embed in Workflows:**  
   - Migrate MADO outputs to team tools/Virtual Obeya.  
3. **Onboard New Members:**  
   - Include Virtual Obeya walkthroughs in onboarding.  
4. **Schedule Reviews:**  
   - Revisit MADOs quarterly or after major changes.  

**Closing Script:**  
> *"Your Virtual Obeya is a living system. Commit today to:  
> - Implement actions by [date].  
> - Review outputs quarterly.  
> - Evolve it as your organization grows."*

### **Appendix: Key Concepts**  
#### **What is an Obeya?**  
- Japanese: 大部屋 ("big room").  
- Origins: Toyota Production System.  
- Purpose: Visibility, transparency, accountability.  
- **Virtual Obeya:** Digital evolution retaining physical Obeya traits while enabling org-wide information radiation.  

#### **Outcomes Enabled**  
- Directional alignment → Team autonomy.  
- Centralized access to critical information.  
- Transparent, fact-based decision-making.  
- Strategic intent clarity at all levels.

**Refinements Summary:**  
1. **Structure:** Unified headings, removed redundancies (e.g., repeated "wrapping up" sections).  
2. **Consistency:** Standardized MADO processes and scripts.  
3. **Readability:** Clear sections, bullet points, and bold highlights.  
4. **Flow:** Logical progression from setup (signals/value) → execution (MADOs) → sustainment (wrapping up).  
5. **Actionability:** Explicit instructions and scripts for facilitators.
