### **FACILITATION GUIDE: LEADERSHIP MAP**  
*(Refined & Consolidated)*  

---

#### **INTRODUCTION**  
Based on Ken Wilber’s **[Integral Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber))**, the Leadership Map addresses organizational change by recognizing that human systems combine:  
- **Visible** (processes, structures) and **invisible** (culture, mindset) elements  
- **Individual** (sense-making) and **collective** (collaborative) dynamics  
> *"Be the most ethical, responsible, and authentic you can be with every breath... you are cutting a path into tomorrow that others will follow."*  
> — Ken Wilber  

---

#### **WHEN TO USE THE LEADERSHIP MAP**  
- New leadership teams establishing their system.  
- Existing teams navigating **remote/hybrid transition**.  
- Post **operating model/organizational change**.  
- Addressing leadership challenges (e.g., low engagement, retention issues).  

---

#### **VALUE PROPOSITION**  
- **Structured conversations** about remote leadership challenges.  
- **Collaborative backlog** of improvement actions.  
- **Coaching opportunities** through powerful dialogue.  

---

#### **KEY TOOLS**  
1. **Remote High Performance Assessment** (Google Forms/other formats).  
2. **Leadership Map Canvas** (PDF/Miro/other formats).

### **FACILITATION PROCESS**  
#### **PHASE 1: GATHER INSIGHTS**  
*(Pre-session, async)*  
- **Sources**: Remote assessment, engagement surveys, performance data, pulse checks, stakeholder interviews.  
- **Output**: Thematic summary to frame session focus.  

---

#### **PHASE 2: EXPLORE THE MAP**  
*(Synchronous session; 90-min minimum)*  
| **Quadrant**               | **Focus**                                                                 | **Key Prompts**                                                                 |  
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **1. Leading Our Teams**   | Vision, clarity, competence, and care for *team success*.                | *Clarity*: How will remote teams access critical information?<br>*Competence*: What skills do WE need to lead remotely?<br>*Care*: How do we anticipate team needs? |  
| **2. Leading Our Systems** | Aligning *processes, safety, and skills* for remote effectiveness.       | *Clarity*: Do systems prevent proximity bias?<br>*Competence*: How do we identify remote bottlenecks?<br>*Care*: Are skill-development systems future-proof? |  
| **3. Leading Together**    | *Trust, decision-making, and psychological safety* within the leadership team. | *Clarity*: How do we share decisions?<br>*Competence*: How will we work as one team?<br>*Care*: How do we integrate work/life? |  
| **4. Leading Ourselves**   | *Self-awareness, mindset, and self-care* for sustainable leadership.     | *Clarity*: Does your work align with personal values?<br>*Competence*: What habits must you build/unlearn?<br>*Care*: How do you practice self-care? |  

**Facilitation Tips**:  
- ⏱️ **Timebox**: 15–20 min per quadrant.  
- 🔍 **Activities**: Affinity mapping, "Movie Posters" (for high-trust groups).  
- 🎯 **Ownership**: Facilitators own *process*; leaders own *content/outcomes*.  
- 💬 **Respect Fear**: Acknowledge discomfort; invite boundary-setting.  

---

#### **PHASE 3: LAUNCH IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM**  
1. **Develop Backlog** (Async):  
   - Synthesize insights into actionable themes.  
   - Draft interventions (e.g., *Leadership Launch*, *Operating Model Design*).  
2. **Prioritize & Launch** (Sync):  
   - Review backlog → Feedback → Prioritize (e.g., effort/impact matrix).  
   - **Output**: Published improvement backlog.  
3. **Execute & Measure**:  
   - Form cross-functional team.  
   - Capture baseline metrics → Execute → Re-assess every 3–6 months.  

---

### **FACILITATION TIPS**  
#### **Live Sessions**  
- **Duration**: 90 min (min.) to full-day offsites.  
- **Balance**: Equal time per quadrant; avoid over-indexing on one.  
- **Safety**: Address hesitations early; leaders set boundaries.  

#### **Async Adaptation**  
- **Fluency**: Match async depth to team norms.  
- **Focus**: Prevent over-analysis with clear prompts/time limits.  
- **Sensitivity**: Avoid async for high-stakes/personal topics.  

---

### **CLOSING**  
- **Actions**: Capture decisions → Assign owners → Track progress.  
- **Reflection**: Identify cross-quadrant correlations.  
- **Value**: Realized through *action execution*, not just discussion.
