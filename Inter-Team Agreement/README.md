# **Inter-Team Agreement Design Workshop Guide**  
*(Streamlined for Remote/Hybrid Teams)*  

---

### **Why This Matters**  
> *"The biggest barriers to speed and quality exist **between** teams—in queues and invisible dependencies. Designing intentional interactions unlocks performance."*

### **When to Use This Workshop**  
| **Trigger**                          | **Example Scenario**                                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| After operating model redesign       | New team structures needing clear collaboration     |
| Troubled team relationships          | Recurring conflicts/misalignment between groups     |
| Dependency chain bottlenecks         | Work stalled waiting for other teams' outputs       |
| Post-retrospective action planning   | "Interaction issues" identified in team reflections |
| Regular operating cadence            | Bi-annual check-ins (recommended)                   |

### **Core Structure**  
*90-Minute Session Flow:*  
1. **Purpose Alignment** (30 min)  
   - *Output:* Shared purpose statement  
2. **Interaction Reflection** (30 min)  
   - *Output:* Retrospective insights (keep/improve/stop)  
3. **Interface Design** (30 min)  
   - *Output:* Actionable improvement experiments

### **Key Facilitator Notes**  
#### ▶︎ Participant Selection  
- Include 1-3 reps per team (leaders + deep domain experts)  
- **Critical:** Mix of perspectives (e.g., technical, customer-facing, ops)  

#### ▶︎ Live Facilitation  
- **Ownership balance:** You own *process*, teams own *content*  
- **Anti-perfectionism:** Focus on progress, not perfect agreements  

#### ▶︎ Async Prep Work  
| **Do**                                  | **Avoid**                          |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pre-share canvases/plans/APIs           | Starting cold in live session      |
| Document leadership constraints upfront | Surprise policy reveals mid-workshop |
| Use surveys for data capture            | Manual info-gathering during timebox |

### **Workshop Toolkit**  
#### **1. Define Collective Purpose**  
*Template:*  
> *"We interact when **[trigger]** to **[action]** so that **[benefit]."*  

*Examples:*  
> 🔹 *"When service activation completes → share order/service details → ensure accurate customer billing."*  
> 🔹 *"When new message queue needed → coordinate crypto/VPN setup → protect customer data."*  

#### **2. Interaction Retrospective**  
*Prime Directive Reminder:*  
> *"Everyone did their best given their context, skills, and resources at the time."*  

*Focus Areas:*  
- How this interaction fits into teams’ broader workflows  
- Resolve misunderstandings *in real-time*  
- Capture: ✅ What works | ⚠️ Pain points | 🚧 Future risks  

#### **3. Interface Redesign**  
*Spark Ideas With These Prompts:*  
| **Strategy**               | **Tactical Examples**                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Eliminate** interfaces   | Automate handoffs; create self-service tools  |
| **Simplify** interactions  | Shared dashboards; cross-team office hours    |
| **Reduce** frequency       | Predictable sync points; escalation frameworks|
| **Enhance** quality/speed  | Limit WIP; prioritize blocker resolution      |

*Decision Tip:* Consolidate ideas → Vote → Assign top 1-2 experiments

### **Post-Workshop Critical Actions**  
1. **Track commitments**  
   - Document owners/deadlines for each experiment  
2. **Update "Group Memory"**  
   - Convert workshop outputs to team wiki/playbook format  
3. **Onboard new members**  
   - Use purpose statements + interaction patterns in onboarding  
4. **Schedule check-ins**  
   - Review interaction health quarterly or after major changes

### **FAQ for Facilitators**  
**Q:** *Can we run this with >2 teams?*  
> ✅ Yes—focus on clusters with high interdependencies.  

**Q:** *What if artifacts (e.g., Team APIs) don’t exist?*  
> ▶︎ Use existing docs (SLAs, chat logs, project plans) as proxies.  

**Q:** *How to handle conflicts during reflection?*  
> ▶︎ Return to the Prime Directive. Ask: *"What system conditions caused this?"*
