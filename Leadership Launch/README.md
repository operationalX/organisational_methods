# **Leadership Launch Facilitation Guide**  
*Aligning teams to maximize organizational impact*

---

### **Introduction**  
Every successful organization requires focused leadership. Yet, teams often veer off track—facing misalignment, unproductive meetings, or over-involvement in execution vs. strategic guidance. Remote/hybrid work exacerbates these challenges.

**Purpose**: The Leadership Launch aligns teams to strengthen focus, collaboration, and organizational impact.  

---

### **Signals for a Leadership Launch**  
Conduct when leaders experience:  
- Team fatigue  
- Misalignment  
- Excessive meetings (virtual/in-person)  
- Over-involvement in day-to-day tasks  
- Poor inter-leader communication/transparency  
- Operating model changes  

---

### **Value Proposition**  
Using **asynchronous collaboration** and **targeted conversations**, this process helps teams:  
1. Establish expected behaviors  
2. Shift focus from *working in* to *working on* the organization  
3. Refine communication channels to reduce contact time  
**Output**: A living document for continuous improvement.

### **Facilitation Principles**  
#### **Live Facilitation**  
- **Session Duration**:  
  - *Avoid* cramming all 4 sections (System, Alliance, Cadence, Meetings) in one day.  
  - Run max 1 section per business day.  
- **Timeboxes**:  
  - Use suggested timings as guidance.  
  - End on time; capture unfinished work as actions.  
- **Efficiency**: Skip low-value activities.  
- **Ownership**:  
  - Facilitator owns the *process*; participants own *content/outcomes*.  
- **Psychological Safety**:  
  - Acknowledge fears; establish boundaries upfront.  

#### **Async Facilitation**  
- **Fluency**: Scale async work to team norms (avoid overloading meeting-centric teams).  
- **Constraints**: Set clear time limits to prevent over-polishing.  
- **Data Capture**: Use surveys/existing docs to fast-track activities.  
- **Documentation**: Explicitly record pre-agreed constraints/outcomes.

### **Post-Workshop Actions**  
1. **Action Tracking**: Prioritize completing decisions/actions surfaced during sessions.  
2. **Group Memory**: Transfer outputs (**System**, **Alliance**, **Cadence**, **Meetings**) to the team’s knowledge management tool.  
3. **Reflection**: Revisit sections periodically as the team evolves.  
4. **Onboarding**: Use outputs to onboard new leaders.

### **Section 1: Leadership System**  
**Purpose**: Maximize leaders’ time through delegation, decision clarity, and improvement metrics.  

#### **Async Prep**  
- Prepare a shared board with context notes.  
- **Briefing (15 mins)**: Ask participants to catalog:  
  - Distractions (*Lifting Our Eyes*)  
  - Decision types (*Decision Design*)  
  - Performance measures (*Measures*)  

#### **Live Session (90 mins)**  
- Validate async inputs, capture actions.  
**Outcomes**:  
- Clarity on time spent *in* vs. *on* the organization.  
- Actions to increase strategic focus.  
- Defined decision structures/support.  
- Data-informed improvement metrics.  

#### **Key Activities**  
1. **Lifting Our Eyes**:  
   - Compare *ideal* vs. *actual* time allocation across:  
     - Setting direction  
     - Building/improving systems  
     - "Stuck in the weeds"  
   - *Synchronous recommended*.  

2. **Decision Design**:  
   - Map decisions to: Executive/Leader/Team/Individual.  
   - Define support (frameworks, escalation paths).  
   - *Tip*: Push decisions to "Individual" with guardrails.  

3. **Measures**:  
   - Identify metrics for customer/group/team performance.  
   - Stress-test metrics for misuse/value.  
   - *Tip*: Automate where possible.

### **Section 2: Leadership Alliance**  
**Purpose**: Foster collaboration, social dynamics, and team growth.  

#### **Async Prep**  
- Same as Section 1.  

#### **Live Session (90 mins)**  
**Outcomes**:  
- Stronger peer connections.  
- Awareness of team dynamics.  
- Documented desired behaviors.  

#### **Key Activities**  
1. **Story.Me**:  
   - Share personal/professional traits via cards (Home/Work/Fun/Identify Me).  
   - *Async tip*: Pre-load cards; add leadership prompts:  
     - *"Traits I rely on/watch out for."*  

2. **Collaboration (SCARF Model)**:  
   - Rank motivators: **S**tatus, **C**ertainty, **A**utonomy, **R**elatedness, **F**airness.  
   - Discuss how preferences impact teamwork.  

3. **Leadership Behaviors**:  
   - Define norms for:  
     - **Vibe** (team culture)  
     - **Difficulty** (navigating conflict)  
     - **Growth** (team development)  
     - **Support** (reliability)  
   - *Synchronous recommended*.

### **Section 3: Leadership Meetings**  
**Purpose**: Streamline communication channels and cadence.  

#### **Async Prep**  
- Prepare board; brief team (15 mins).  

#### **Live Session (60 mins)**  
**Outcomes**:  
- Alignment on activities/tools for collaboration.  
- Clear sync/async splits.  
- Scheduled events.  

#### **Key Activities**  
1. **Channels of Communication**:  
   - Map activities → tools → urgency (e.g., urgent/FYI).  
   - Identify gaps; plan for emergencies.  
   - *Synchronous recommended*.  

2. **Event Schedule**:  
   - Calendarize key activities.  
   - Challenge: *"What can be async?"*  
   - Assign owners to schedule events post-workshop.
