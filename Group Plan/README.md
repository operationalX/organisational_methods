# **Group Planning Facilitation Guide**  
*Adaptive Short-Cycle Planning for Rapid Environments*

---

### **Introduction**  
Group Planning is a **flexible, rolling process** integrated into your team’s regular cadence—not a rigid quarterly event. It enables:  
- Simplified portfolio alignment  
- Early detection of capability gaps, risks, dependencies & capacity constraints  
- Agile adaptation to changing priorities  
- Leadership alignment with team realities  

> **Core Principle**: *Tailor the cycle to your context. Prioritize continuous planning over big-bang sessions.*

---

### **Signals That Indicate Need for Group Planning**  
Adopt this approach if your organization faces:  
- **Plan instability** post-quarter/PI due to:  
  - Market shifts, priority changes, capacity issues  
  - Unfinished work, hidden dependencies/constraints, misalignment  
- **Reactive escalations** where leadership discovers delivery blockers late  

---

### **Value Proposition**  
- **Contextual clarity**: Teams synchronize plans *after* drafting, enabling deeper alignment.  
- **Proactive issue resolution**: Surface unresolved complications/dependencies needing leadership input.  
- **Adaptive cadence**: Leadership establishes principles & rhythms to respond to change faster.

### **Key Facilitation Guidelines**  
#### **Live Sessions**  
- **Duration**:  
  - Initial session: ≤4 hours (covers all 5 sections).  
  - Recurring sessions: Time reduces with practice.  
- **Phases**: Always include **Pre-Planning**, **Synchronization**, and **Post-Planning**.  
- **Timeboxes**: Enforce strictly. Park unfinished work as *actions*.  
- **Ownership**: Facilitator owns *process*; participants own *content/outcomes*.  
- **Psychological Safety**: Acknowledge discomfort with autonomy; invite leaders to set boundaries upfront.  

#### **Async Facilitation**  
- **Fluency**: Match async depth to team norms (avoid overloading meeting-centric teams).  
- **Focus**: Provide clear constraints to prevent over-investment in low-value tasks.  
- **Efficiency**: Pre-populate templates with existing data (e.g., backlogs, RAIDs).  
- **Transparency**: Document leader-decided constraints *before* team input.

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|  
| **Pre-Planning**  | Socialize strategy, OKRs, RAIDs; Collect capacity/capability data                 | Team Planning Canvas       |  
| **Planning**      | Build team roadmaps; Prioritize backlog; Map dependencies                         | Team Planning Canvas       |  
| **Synchronization**| Playback plans; Resolve complications; Assign actions; Align on monitoring        | Group Planning Canvas      |  
| **Post-Planning** | Update tools; Action complications; Start next cycle prep                         | Backlogs, RAIDs, Actions   |

### **Phase Details**  
#### **1. Pre-Planning Phase**  
*Ensure teams start aligned.*  
**Socialize**:  
- Strategic roadmap (even if unchanged)  
- Relevant OKRs  
**Collect & Resolve**:  
- Capacity/capability constraints  
- RAIDs (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)  
- Unfinished work  

> **Async Tip**: Use Q&A channels; proactively confirm understanding.  

#### **2. Planning Phase**  
*Teams prepare draft plans.*  
**Develop** (using Team Planning Canvas):  
- Team roadmap ← Group roadmap/OKRs  
- Increment goals (e.g., next 4 weeks)  
- Prioritized backlog (initiatives, BAU, compliance)  
- Capacity plan (accounting for leave, events, skills gaps)  
- Mapped RAIDs (cross-team/portfolio)  

> **Async Tip**: Pre-share plans; clarify cross-portfolio dependencies async.  

#### **3. Synchronization Phase**  
*Align plans & resolve conflicts.*  
**Structure (Group Canvas)**:  
- **Plan Area**: Team plans (Now/Next/Later horizons)  
- **Complications**: Delivery blockers (team-prioritized)  
- **Actions**: Proposed/resolving steps  
- **Landscape**: Key stakeholders & dependencies  
**Process**:  
1. **Briefing** (15 min): Set expectations.  
2. **Playback** (≤15 min/team): Share plans + complications.  
3. **Sync** (≤20 min/team):  
   - Q&A from leaders/teams  
   - Agree on actions/mitigations (owner + deadline)  
   - Define monitoring rhythm  
4. **Reflection** (≤30 min): Improve future cycles.  

#### **4. Post-Planning Phase**  
*Embed outcomes & sustain momentum.*  
- **Update systems**: Backlogs, portfolios, workflow tools.  
- **Action**: Resolve complications/dependencies.  
- **Prep next cycle**: Initiate next increment planning immediately.  

---

### **Maximizing Value**  
- **Actions**: Track and close all session-generated actions *urgently*.  
- **Group Memory**: Transfer outputs (Plan, Complications, Actions, Landscape, Summary) to accessible knowledge tools.  
- **Reflection**: Revisit plans quarterly or after major team/environment changes.
