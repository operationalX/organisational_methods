# **Team Group Launch Framework**

## **Introduction**  
A structured approach to launching effective team groups, ensuring alignment, clarity, and scalability for new members.

---

## **Value Proposition**  
Empowers teams to define their purpose, workflows, agreements, and rituals efficiently through guided facilitation.

---

### **Live Facilitation Best Practices**  
- **Session Duration**:  
  - Avoid day-long sessions. Conduct one section (Context, Work, Agreement, Meetings) per business day.  
- **Timeboxes**:  
  - Adhere strictly to section time limits. Capture unfinished work as actions.  
- **Finishing Early**:  
  - Skip/low-priority activities if irrelevant to your team.  
- **Ownership**:  
  - Facilitators own the *process*; participants own *content/outcomes*.  
- **Respect Fear**:  
  - Acknowledge discomfort with autonomy. Involve leaders to set boundaries upfront.  

---

### **Async Facilitation Principles**  
- **Fluency**:  
  - Match async intensity to your team’s collaboration norms.  
- **Unboxed Time**:  
  - Prevent over-investment in low-value work with clear constraints.  
- **Data Capture**:  
  - Use surveys/existing data to accelerate activities.  
- **Document Constraints**:  
  - Explicitly record pre-decided leader inputs.  

---

### **Wrapping Up**  
- **Actions**: Track and complete decisions/actions surfaced during sessions.  
- **Group Memory**: Migrate outputs (**Context**, **Agreement**, **Work**, **Meetings**) to team knowledge tools.  
- **Reflection**: Revisit sections periodically as teams evolve.  
- **Onboarding**: Use outputs as new-member onboarding baseline.  

---

## **1. Context**  
**Purpose**: Articulate the group’s role, environment, and dependencies.  
### *Async Preparation*  
- **Prepare**: Gather stakeholder/value stream maps, RAID logs, strategy docs.  
- **Briefing (15 mins)**: Explain activities; allow 1 week for async contributions.  
### *Live Facilitation (90 mins)*  
  - Triage relationships  
  - Clarify drivers, dependencies, and group uniqueness  
  - Draft purpose statement  
### *Outcomes*: Aligned purpose, workflow, success measures, decision clarity, sync meetings.  

#### **Key Activities**  
- **Relationships**: Map internal/external customers/stakeholders. Prioritize high-need relationships (bottom of columns → actions).  
- **Work**: Capture:  
  - *Strategic Intent* (org expectations)  
  - *Unmet Needs* (customer dissatisfaction)  
  - *Sources of Demand* (work origins).  
- **Dependency**:  
  - Internal (top triangle), External (bottom triangle), Ambiguous (near "?").  
  - Derive flow risks → assign actions.  
- **Edge**: Define:  
  1. Group speciality  
  2. Differentiation  
  3. Focus area.  
- **Purpose**: Draft statement via team inputs → theme grouping → small-group refinement.  

---

## **2. Work**  
**Purpose**: Combat process bloat by clarifying workflows, metrics, and delegations.  
### *Async Preparation*  
- **Prepare**: Value stream/customer journey maps, RAID logs, PMO policies, performance metrics.  
- **Briefing (15 mins)**: Async contributions in 1 week.  
### *Live Facilitation (120 mins)*  
  - Define group workflow  
  - Set success measures  
  - Delegate authority  
### *Outcomes*: Shared workflow, success metrics, decision clarity.  

#### **Key Activities**  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. Import "Sources of Demand" (Context).  
  2. Categorize work: *Planned*, *Unplanned*, *Expedite*.  
  3. Map stages per category (+ rework process notes).  
  4. Test workflow with historic work example.  
  5. Define leadership review rhythm.  
- **Measures**:  
  - Clarify metrics for:  
    a. Customer impact  
    b. Team success  
    c. Group performance.  
  - Limit to 3–5 core metrics initially.  
- **Decision Design**:  
  - Categorize recent decisions:  
    *Executive*, *Leader*, *Team*, *Individual*.  
  - Clarify role-specific decisions (e.g., leave approvals).  

---

## **3. Agreement**  
**Purpose**: Foster collaboration via behavioral standards, structure, and improvement focus.  
### *Async Preparation*  
- **Prepare**: Company values, vision statements, HR policies.  
- **Briefing (15 mins)**: Async contributions in 1 week.  
### *Live Facilitation (120 mins)*  
  - Define group culture  
  - Align structure/resolve tensions  
  - Create improvement backlog  
### *Outcomes*: Social contract, team structure clarity, tension actions, CI backlog.  

#### **Key Activities**  
- **Values & Behavior**: Capture inputs for:  
  1. *Vibe* (desired work feel)  
  2. *Growth* (growth behaviors)  
  3. *Conflict* (disagreement resolution)  
  4. *Support* (mutual expectations).  
- **Team Structure**:  
  1. List all teams in group.  
  2. Identify key handovers (info, work, approvals).  
  3. Note critical external interfaces.  
  4. Resolve tensions → actions.  
- **Group Development**: Plan for:  
  - *Interactions* (team/org dynamics)  
  - *People* (growth/care)  
  - *Facilities* (tools/space)  
  - *Process* (workflow management).

## **4. Meetings**  
**Purpose**: Optimize time via intentional meeting design.  
### *Async Preparation*  
- **Prepare**: Existing event docs, calendar exports.  
- **Briefing (15 mins)**: Async contributions in 1 week.  
### *Live Facilitation (45 mins)*  
  - Define meeting cadence (annual → weekly)  
  - Streamline/reduce events  
### *Outcomes*: Alignment on essential events; reduced meeting load.  

#### **Key Activity**  
- **Channels of Communication**:  
  1. For new groups: Establish baseline events:  
    - Demand prioritization  
    - Cross-team planning  
    - Value demonstration  
    - Improvement  
    - Dependency/risk management.  
  2. For each cadence (annual → weekly):  
    - List events  
    - Define purpose/owner  
    - Shift work async to shorten/eliminate meetings.  

> **Next Steps**:  
> - Customize "sample introduction scripts" for your context.  
> - Use timeboxes as guardrails during facilitation.  
> - Prioritize outcomes → actions → documentation.
