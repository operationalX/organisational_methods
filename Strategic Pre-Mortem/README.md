# **Strategic Pre-mortem Facilitation Guide**  
*Proactively Identify Risks to Ensure Project Success*  

---

## **Introduction**  
A strategic pre-mortem is a proactive exercise where teams envision a project has **already failed** to surface risks, blind spots, and mitigation strategies. Based on research by [Gary Klein](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem), this method:  
- Leverages domain expertise and skepticism constructively.  
- Uncovers overlooked risks before execution begins.  
- Fosters psychological safety for candid input.  
- **Scalability:** Works for strategies, programs, projects, or small work items.  

> *Example: We used a pre-mortem while drafting this guide. We asked: “If this document fails and needs restarting, what went wrong?” This took 15 minutes but revealed critical gaps.*

## **When to Run a Pre-mortem**  
**Key signals:**  
- Skepticism: *“This failed the last 5 times we tried.”*  
- Warnings: *“This can’t work because…”*  
- Frustration: *“Why doesn’t leadership listen?”*  
**Ideal timing:** Before kickoff or major phase transitions.

## **Value Proposition**  
- **Prevent repeat failures** by learning from past mistakes.  
- **Engage experts** (including skeptics) to build buy-in.  
- **Surface risks early** when mitigation is most effective.

### Key Considerations  
| Element          | Guidance                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Participants** | 5–10 domain experts, leaders, and skeptics. Ensure psychological safety. |
| **Duration**     | 60–90 minutes. Schedule follow-up to track action completion.           |
| **Ownership**    | Facilitator owns the process; participants own content/outcomes.        |
| **Flexibility**  | Skip irrelevant sections for smaller-scale work.                        |

## **Async Facilitation**  
### Best Practices  
1. **Team Fluency:**  
   - Match async intensity to your team’s collaboration style.  
2. **Time Boxing:**  
   - Set clear deadlines to prevent over-analysis.  
3. **Data Capture:**  
   - Pre-share project plans, lessons learned, or Lean Canvases.  
4. **Constraints:**  
   - Document non-negotiables upfront (e.g., budget, timelines).

## **Workshop Flow**  
### 1. Original Goal (10 mins)  
**Script:** *“What problem does this work solve? Does everyone agree?”*  
**Activity:**  
- One person states the goal.  
- Validate shared understanding.  
> *⚠️ If debates arise, pause and clarify the goal first.*  

### 2. Current Plan (10 mins)  
**Script:** *“How will we execute? No critiques yet—ensure alignment.”*  
**Activity:**  
- Present the high-level plan.  
- Confirm consensus.  

### 3. Past Failures (Optional, 15 mins)  
**Script:** *“What similar initiatives failed? What lessons apply here?”*  
**Activity:**  
- Individuals list past failures + root causes.  
- Group discusses patterns and records insights.  

### 4. Why Will We Fail? (45 mins)  
**Script:** *“Imagine this project crashed. Why did it fail? Be brutally honest.”*  
**Activity:**  
1. **Brainstorm:** Individuals write failure causes on sticky notes.  
2. **Cluster:** Group similar risks (e.g., “Scope Creep,” “Stakeholder Misalignment”).  
3. **Prioritize:** Plot risks on a Likelihood/Impact matrix.  
4. **Mitigate:** Assign owners and actions for top 3–5 risks.

## **Wrapping Up**  
### Critical Next Steps  
- **Actions:** Track mitigation tasks with deadlines and owners.  
- **Documentation:** Save outputs in team knowledge hubs (e.g., Notion, Confluence).  
- **Onboarding:** Use pre-mortem insights to accelerate new member ramp-up.  
- **Revisit:** Review quarterly or after major changes.

## **Outcomes**  
1. Documented risks with mitigation plans.  
2. Increased team alignment and psychological safety.  
3. Proactive reduction of failure likelihood.
